# Inheritance:
## Overview

Module_03 focuses on the fundamental concept of inheritance in C++, which is a core feature of object-oriented programming (OOP). Inheritance allows us to create new classes (derived or child classes) that inherit attributes and behaviors from existing classes (base or parent classes). This powerful mechanism promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class structures.

In this module, we delve into the following key aspects of inheritance:

1. **Base and Derived Classes:** Learn how to define base classes with common attributes and member functions, and then create derived classes that inherit these properties.

2. **Access Control:** Understand the concepts of public, protected, and private inheritance, and how they affect the accessibility of base class members in the derived class.

3. **Constructor and Destructor Inheritance:** Explore how constructors and destructors work in inheritance, including invoking base class constructors and destructors from derived classes.

4. **Polymorphism:** Discover how inheritance plays a crucial role in enabling polymorphism, which allows objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.

By mastering inheritance, you'll gain a deeper understanding of code organization and design, making your C++ programs more modular and maintainable. This module provides hands-on exercises and examples to solidify your understanding of inheritance in C++.

Whether you're new to OOP or looking to strengthen your C++ skills, Module_03 is a pivotal step in your programming journey.
